Dipy is an **international**, **free** and **open** software project for **diffusion** magnetic resonance imaging analysis in Python. The project is at a massive development at the moment and many things are likely to change the following months. However, if you are already using this software for your research please remember to cite us.

Please see our :ref:`documentation` for more detail.

**Join in the fun** and enjoy the `video <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNB0sM7JJqg>`_  we made for the Summer Exhibition in London for the celebration of the 350 years of the Royal Society.
