A short list of algorithms 
==========================

Here are just a few of the state-of-the-art technologies and algorithms which are provided in Dipy_:

- Reconstruction algorithms e.g. DSI, GQI, DTI, QBI  
- Fiber tracking algorithms e.g. EuDX
- Intelligent downsampling/compression of streamlines
- Fast tractography clustering using QuickBundles
- Reslice datasets with anisotropic voxels to isotropic
- Calculate distances/correspondences between streamlines of different brains
- Warp/Register tractographies into another space e.g. MNI space
- Reade many different file formats e.g. Trackvis or Nifti
- Deal with huge tractographies without memory restrictions (.dpy)
- Play and examine your datasets interactively (with ipython)
