Dependencies
============

Depends on a few standard libraries: python_ (the core language), numpy_ (for
numerical computation), scipy_ (for more specific mathematical operations),
cython_ (for extra speed) and nibabel_ (for file formats; we require version 2.1
or higher). Optionally, it can use python-vtk_ (for visualisation), pytables_
(for handling large datasets), matplotlib_ (for scientific plotting), and
ipython_ (for interaction with the code and its results). cvxopt_ (version
1.1.7 or later) is required for some modules.
