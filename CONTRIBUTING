# Contributing to Dipy

Dipy is an open-source software project, and we have an open development
process. This means that we welcome contributions from anyone. We do ask that
you first read this document and follow the guidelines we have outlined here and
that you follow the [NIPY community code of conduct](http://nipy.org/conduct.html).

## Getting started

If you are looking for places that you could make a meaningful contribution,
please contact us! We respond to queries on the [Nipy mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/neuroimaging), and to questions
on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/nipy/dipy). A good place to get a
sense of things that currently need attention is the
[issues](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/issues) page of our Github repository.
This page collects outstanding issues that you can help address. Join the
conversation about the issue, by typing into the text box in the issue page.

## The development process

Please refer to the [development section](http://nipy.org/dipy/devel/index.html)
of the documentation for the procedures we use in developing the code.

When writing code, please pay attention to the following:

## Supporting both Python 2 and 3.

Most of the functionality in Dipy works on both Python 3 and Python 2. Please
follow the instructions [here](http://nipy.org/dipy/devel/python3.html) to
write code that works on both versions.

## Code style
Code contributions should be formatted according to the
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide. There are
[software systems](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) that will check your Code
for you for compliance, and most text editors can be configured to check the
compliance of yoru code
